# Microsoft Exchange Online Protection IPs

Inofficial mirror of https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn163583.aspx

## Rationale

It may be difficult to automatically process the list of the IP addresses provided by the official source.
To solve this, the IPs are hosted as plain text files in a git repository.

## Contribution

* Changes of the IPs are documented at https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn163581.aspx
* Pull requests must reflect only changes documented there, any other changes are not permitted
